# LunarLander
A game engine and Lunar Lander game built in C++ and OpenGL.

Game jams are good for trying something new, so I tried making a game without a game engine. I ended up with the beginnings of both a game engine and game of Lunar Lander. [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/) has been very helpful.
